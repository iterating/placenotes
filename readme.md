A loved one arrives at the imposing corporate tower where they are having thier interview, and gets a message:

"You've got this! You're not just qualified for this role; you're the perfect fit. Go in there and show them the incredible person I see every day. I'm so proud of you and I'm cheering you on all the way. ðŸ’–"

You arrive at Costco, and get a message:

" 2024.10.25 out of paper towel rolls

- [ ] eggs
- [ ] milk
- [ ] oatmeal
- [x] cheese got xl pack 10-15
- [ ] malbec wine "

It's your Costco shopping list, and it pops up when you arrive at Costco.

**Placenotes** is a powerful messaging and notetaking app that adds the element of location to your messages. Supporting Markdown formatting, it can be used as a notetaking app or a messaging app.

Built with Express and Mongodb
This is a work in progress.

## Express server application

### GraphQL API

The Placenotes server includes a GraphQL API. The API is defined in the `server/models/graphqlSchema.js` file.

### RESTful API

The Placenotes server is a RESTful API build on Express that supports the following actions:

- POST users/login or users/signup
  - Directs user to login form
- POST users/login or users/signup

  - Creates a new user

- GET /users/all
  - Retrieves all users
- GET /users/:id
  - Retrieves the user with the specified id
  * alternate: GET /users?id=:id
- GET /users/:name
  - Retrieves the user with the specified name
  * alternate: GET /users?name=:name
- GET /users/email/:email
  - retrieves user with the specified email
  - alternate /users?email=:email
- GET /users/group/:group
  - retrieves user by the specified group
  - alternate /users?email=:email
- GET /users/:id/notes

  - Retrieves all notes for the user with the specified id

- GET /users/:id/time/:time

  - Retrieves all notes for the user at the specified time

  * alternate /users/:id/?time=:time

- GET /users/:id/notes/:id
  - Retrieved a single note wiht \_id ot noteId for the user with the specified \_id of userId
- PUT /users/:id/notes/:id
  - Updates a single note wiht \_id ot noteId for the user with the specified \_id of userId
- DELETE /users/:id/notes/:id

  - Deletes a single note for the user with the specified id

- GET /notes
  - Retrieves all notes for the logged in user
- GET /notes/:id

  - Retrieves the note with the specified id

- GET /notes/time/:time
  - Retrieces note created by the logged in user and the specified time
- PUT /notes//time/:time
  - Updates note created by the logged in user and the specified time
- DELETE /notes/time/:time

  - Deletes note created by the logged in user and the specified time

- GET /notes/location/:lat/:lon
  - Retrieves notes created at the specified latitude and longitude

### Middleware

- The application runs the following **middleware**:
  - `autoLogin`: checks if a user is logged in and if not attempts to log them in using a cookie if present
  - `setUser`: sets the user on the request object if the user is logged in.
  - `passport.js`: Provides authentication services. Future development will include Google OAuth.
### Client
- React client is built using Vite and React Router.
## System Design

- The app uses the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture to separate concerns between the database, user interface, and application logic. This allows for easier maintenance and scalability of the application.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] --> B[Controller]
    B --> C[Service]
    C --> D[Model]
    D --> E[Database]
    E --> D
    D --> C
    C --> B
    B --> F[View]
    F --> A
```

- **Model**: defines the data layer of the application, which includes the database schema and any operations that interact with the database. This layer is responsible for retrieving and storing data in the database.
- **View**: defines the user interface layer of the application, which includes the templates and static assets. This layer is responsible for rendering the user interface and any static assets.
- **Controller**: defines the application logic layer of the application, which includes the API endpoints and any operations that interact with the View. It calls the service layer to perform business logic.
  - The **Routes** defines API end points and maps them to controller functions.
- **Service Layer**: Here is the business logic of the application. It interacts with the models to perform database operations.

## Database Schema
```mermaid
erDiagram
    Group {
        ObjectId _id
        string name
        array notes
    }

    Point {
        string type
        array coordinates
    }

    Note {
        ObjectId _id
        string userId
        string email
        string locationType
        array locationCoordinates
        number radius
        date time
        string body
        array recipients
    }

    NoteRecipients {
        ObjectId userId
        date readAt
    }

    User {
        ObjectId _id
        string email
        string name
        string group
        string password
        string currentLocationType
        array currentLocationCoordinates
        date createdAt
        date lastActive
    }

    User ||--o{ Note : "created"
    Note ||--o{ NoteRecipients : "has"
    User }o--|| Group : "member of"

```

## How To Run

1. `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. `npm run seed` to seed the database with sample data
3. `npm start` to start the server and client  in development mode
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `localhost:5173` to access the app

## Todo

- [ ] realtime communication library
- [ ] Redux for state for real time updates
